Null VALUE CHECK
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE customer_id IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE product_id IS NULL;
-no null value were found

Duplicate rows detection: to identify potential duplicate customer records
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*)
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-found duplicate 

Duplicate rows validation :to varify whether duplicates are legitimate
select * from customer where customer_id ='LT-16765';
-identified that duplicates are legimate and retained  

Exact duplicate records (matching across all business columns except the primary key) were removed. 
DELETE FROM customer a
USING customer b
WHERE a.row_id > b.row_id
  AND a.order_id = b.order_id
  AND a.order_date = b.order_date
  AND a.ship_date = b.ship_date
  AND a.ship_mode = b.ship_mode
  AND a.customer_id = b.customer_id
  AND a.customer_name = b.customer_name
  AND a.segment = b.segment
  AND a.country = b.country
  AND a.city = b.city
  AND a.state = b.state
  AND a.postal_code = b.postal_code
  AND a.region = b.region;

Date Standardization
Date columns contained mixed formats, As a result, date standardization was deferred to Power Query

UPDATE CUSTOMER
SET ship_date = TO_DATE(ship_date, 'MM/DD/YYYY');
UPDATE CUSTOMER
SET ship_date = ship_date::DATE; 

update customer
set ship_date= split_part(trim(ship_date),' ',1);
update customer
set order_date= split_part(trim(order_date),' ',1); 

Data type check 
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'customer';

-Basic preprocessing was applied to isolate date values
-Referential integrity verified
-Legitimate duplicates preserved
-Exact duplicates removed
